Tableau Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to show how population of the countries across the world having been developing over the past 50 years.
## Data Source
The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is a CSV file containing financial and overview information about 1000 startups.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection
  - The two sheets in the CSV file, Financials and Overview, are linked to each other using an inner join in Tableau.

- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting
  - Duplicate columns "ID" and "Name" have been removed.
  - Created folders to group the 2013–2014 and 2015 columns together.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We can use the group function in Tableau to combine the data from the previous years (1999–2009) together.

## Final Dashboard
The dashboard includes a revenue cutoff, an expense cutoff, and a slider for top startups by growth percentage. This allows venture capitalists to adjust the values according to their individual requirements when selecting the top startups for investment.
